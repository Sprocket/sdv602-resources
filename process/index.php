<h1>Process</h1>
<p>All web development projects are unique but most will follow a typical process.</p>

<p>Each step has its own deliverables and milestones.</p>

<p>Project management is crucial to running a smooth operation.</p>



<h2>Exploration</h2>
<p>This is when you first meet and start sketching out what the project might look like</p>

<h4>Outcome: notes, mind maps, low-fi wireframes, sketches, interviews, SWOT</h4>

<h2>Specification</h2>
<p>Documentation can be a vital part of any project. A 'Specification' is a document that oulines the key aspects of the project. It ensures that everyone has realistic expectations of the outcomes. It also set out repsonsibilities.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Deliverables</dt>
	<dd>The actual products that will be made</dd>
	<dt>Technical Requirements</dt>
	<dd>Requirements such as third party integration, specific tools, etc.</dd>
	<dt>Budget and Timeframe</dt>
	<dd>How long will the project take and how much will it cost</dd>
	<dt>Content, design</dt>
	<dd>Who will write the content and design the site</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Outcome: Specifcation Document</h4>

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>The stage is when the majority of coding will take place. It is when the ideas are turned into code.</p>

<p>A staging or development server maybe set up.</p>

<h4>Outcome: a functional web app ready for launch</h4>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>This is a crucial time as the production server needs to be properly configured and tested, the site needs to be copied to it, databases need to be set up, and then finally, a launch.</p>

<p>It is at this time that ongoing support and maintenance systems are put into place so ensure the web app will continue to function properly.</p>
