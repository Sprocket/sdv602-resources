<h1>PHP Variables</h1>

<p>PHP is a <em>loosely typed</em> language - a variable can contain any variable type and doesn't need to be declared when setting it. The type can be changed simply by reassigning a new value. You can cast variable; that is, change the type.</p>

<p>Variables do not need to be declared before being set (encouraged in OOP)</p>


<h2>Variable Types</h2>

<h3>Booleans</h3>

<p>the values TRUE or FALSE (case insensetive)</p>

<h3>Integers</h3>

<p>Number without a decimal, including negative numbers
maximum values are platform dependent, usually about 2 Billion
can be specified in decimal, hexadecimal, octal or binary
e.g. 1, -1, 1024, 0</p>

<h3>Floating point numbers</h3>

<p>Numbers with decimal places, also known as "floats", "doubles", or "real numbers"
e.g. 1.234, 1.2e3, 7E-10</p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>A series of characters quoted within single or double quote marks.
Special characters within single quoted strings are not expanded. These include variables and whitespace.
Symbols within double quotes will be converted to their values before returning the string to the browser.
e.g. 'Hello, World', "antidisestablishmentarialism", "123"</p>

<h3>Arrays</h3>

<p>A map of associated <em>values</em> and <em>keys</em>
In other languages these are known as list, hash table, dictionary, collection, stack, queue.
We create an array using the 'array' keyword.
An array may contain other arrays (a 'multi-dimensional array').
Keys have to be integers or strings. A value can be of any type, including variables.
e.g.
$array0 = array( 'apple', 'banana', 'cantelop'); 
$array1 = array( "foo" => "bar"); 
$array3 = array( 'foobar' => array( "foo" => "bar") ); </p>

<h3>Objects</h3>

<p>An object is a collection of functions and variables ('methods' and 'properties').</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>

<p>An external resource, such as a database connectino, a directory listing, an image file, etc.</p>

<h3>NULL</h3>

<p>A variable that exists that has no value
it has been assigned the constant NULL
it has not been set to any value yet
it has been unset()</p>
