<h1>PHP - Introduction</h1>
<h2>What is PHP?</h2>

<p>PHP is a <i>server-side scripting language</i>. It is not downloaded to the browser like HTML, Javascript and CSS, rather executed on the server.</p>

<p>It runs on a web server and usually a module for HTTP servers like Apache and IIS.</p>

<p>It does not need to be compiled - this is effectively done by the server. You also do not need to manage memory.</p>

<p>PHP is derived from C and its syntax is similar to C, C++, C#, Perl, Java and Javascript.</p>

<p>HTML is static whereas PHP is dynamic. It lets you manipulate HTML before it is sent to the browser - this will let you do things like access a database to retrieve credentials or retrieve recent news stories. It will also let you process uploaded files or send emails.</p>

<p>It is usually embedded in HTML or used to output HTML. It responds to events.</p>

<p>PHP can be consider an <i>interpreted language</i> - that is, the source is essentially instructions to an execution engine. It is actually compiled transparently to an internal format. There are some compilers available - such as the open source Hip Hop developed by Facebook - and several cache and code optimizers.</p>

<p>The browser is ignorant the page has been created by PHP (although information sent in the headers will show it is possible.</p>
