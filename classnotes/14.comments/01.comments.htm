		<dd>Shorten and temporary variables might cause confusion</dd>

	<dt>When using an uncommon function or technique</dt>

<h3>Over-commenting</h3>
<p>Sometimes comments just aren't needed. If the code is obvious then there is no need to clutter the code.</p>

<h3>Keep comments short</h3>
<p>Be brief and clear.</p>

<h3>Provide links</h3>
<p>Link to other libraries of code if you use them. This can be useful for documentation and updates.</p>

<p>But remember good code is better than good comments.</p>
