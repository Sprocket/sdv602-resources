<p>The technologies above HTML are <em>client-side</em> and are downloaded and executed by the browser.
Those below HTML are <em>server-side</em>.</p>

<p>Much link common web site development, it is a good idea to keep your different technologies as separate as possible.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>It is possible, and is usually the case, that PHP will be developed on one system and deployed on another.</p>

<p>For example: you develop on a Mac. You stage to a Windows server attached to your local network and then deploy to a production machine running Ubuntu on a remote, shared host.</p>

<p>While this doesn't usually cause problems you have to be mindful of each successive step. Directory structures, file permissions, software versions, installed libraries and modules, database credentials, file paths, etc.</p>
