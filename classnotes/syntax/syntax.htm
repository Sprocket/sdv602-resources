<h1>PHP Syntax</h1>

<p>(http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.basic-syntax.php 'PHP Manual on Basic Syntac')</p>

<p>PHP is derived from C and its syntax is similar to C, C++, C#, Perl, Java and Javascript.</p>

<h2>Opening and Closing Tags</h2>

<p>The delimeters or 'on' and 'off' tags in PHP are:
<code>&lt;?php</code> and <code>?&gt;</code>
You then put your code between them, like this</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
&lt;?php echo 'hello world'; ?&gt;
</pre>

<p>There are variations on these but they are not reccomended as support is not consistent.</p>

<p>Each statement ends in a semicolon. It is conventional to have each statement on its own line.</p>

<h2>Embeding PHP in HTML</h2>

<p>PHP was created as a sort of templating language for HTML. You can disperse them amongst HTML.</p>

<p>A page with a .php extension will be parsed by the PHP engine before being sent to the client. Everything within PHP tags will be parsed - the code will be executed and the results simply inserted into the HTML page.</p>

<p>Everything outside of the PHP tags is ignored by the parser and simply sent to the browser, allowing you to have mixed content.</p>

<p>You can use as many PHP tags on a single page as required.</p>

<h2>Whitespace</h2>

<p>This is not considered significant and is simply collapsed into a single space, this gives you the freedom to layout your code as you see fit.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>There are three types of comments in PHP.</p>

<p>Single line comments
    // This comment will run across one line (generally preferred)
    # As will this one</p>

<p>And mutli-line comments</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">/*
This comment will run across
several lines
*/
</pre>

<p>Use them
* to explain what you are doing when it is not obvious
* when you are doing something non-conventional
* to make a note to others; mark a TODO, etc.
* to temporary disable code</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">$variable = 'hello';    // assigns a value to a variable
echo 4 + $;             // 8
die('I am dead');       // halts execution with a message
myFunction();           // calls a function
echo date('l, F dS Y'); // Saturday, July 14th 2012
</pre>
