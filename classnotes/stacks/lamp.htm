<h1>The LAMP Stack</h1>

<p>A popular architecture for deploying web applications:</p>

<p><strong>Linux</strong> Operating System </p>

<p><strong>Apache</strong> Web Server </p>

<p><strong>MySQL</strong> Database </p>

<p><strong>PHP</strong> Scripting Language</p>

<p>(The 'P' can also include Python and Perl)</p>

<p>Because PHP is cross-platform the operating can also be swapped out for Macintosh, Windows or Other: MAMP, WAMP and XAMP, respectively. As of 5.4 it also has a built-in web server (not recommended for production).</p>

<p>PHP can also run quite happily on IIS, and Nginx, and many other HTTP servers.</p>

<p>It also supports a wide range of databases
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* SQL Server
* Oracle
* SQLite
* ODBC, and more</p>

<p>PHP 5.1 supports PDO (PHP Data Objects) interface for accessing databases. Each database requires a driver but will then allow you to access the data in a convenient way.</p>
