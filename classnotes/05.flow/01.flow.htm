<h1>Control Structures</h1>

<p>Conditional tests are a good way to control the flow of your application. The most commonly used test is the <strong>if</strong> construct.</p>

<p><strong>If</strong> does a test and, if the test is successful (that is, if it returns a truthy value) will then execute the code within curly braces.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( test_something ) {
    // do something
}
</pre>

<p>Sometimes you'll want to do something when the test fails.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( test_something ) {
    // do something
} else {
    // do something else
}
</pre>

<p>For example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( $month == 'January' ) {
    echo 'It is January';
} else {
    echo 'It is not January';
}
</pre>

<p>Other times you will want to run multiple tests:</p>

<p>For example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( $month == 'January' ) {
    echo 'It is January';
} elseif ( $month == 'February' )  {
    echo 'It is February';
} else {
    echo 'It is not January or February';
}
</pre>

<p>You can use as many <code>elseif</code>s as needed, though it will likely make some nasty looking code.</p>

<h2>Numbers</h2>

<p>You can use some other tests when working with numbers</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
&gt; greater than
&lt; less than
&gt;= greater than or equal to
&lt;= less than or equal to
!= does not equal (is not)
</pre>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>You can use the result of functions in your tests too:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( isset( $variable )) {
    // variable has been set
}
</pre>

<p>And also test negation (notice the exclaimation mark)</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( ! isset( $variable )) {
    // variable has NOT been set
}
</pre>

<h2>OR and AND</h2>

<p>You can run multiple tests within the same if. This will test if the month is Janurary <strong>or</strong> February. It uses the 'double pipe' operator.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( $month == 'January' || $month == 'February' ) {
    echo 'It is January or February';
} else {
    echo 'It is not January or February';
}
</pre>

<p>Another option is to check for two requirements using the AND test - which is two ampersands.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( $number &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; $number &lt;= 100 ) {
    echo 'The number is between 1 and 100';
} elseif ( $number &gt; 100 ) {
    echo 'The number is greater than 100';
} else {
    echo 'It is a negative number. How tricky.';
}
</pre>

<p>Note, you can place each part of the test in separate brackets. You can also substitute &amp;&amp; for AND, and || for OR:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( ($number &gt;= 1) AND ($number &lt;= 100) ) {
    ...
</pre>

<p>You can remove the braces if each clause only have a single statement.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums languague-php">
if ( $number &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; $number &lt;= 100 ) echo 'The number is between 1 and 100';
elseif ( $number &gt; 100 ) echo 'The number is greater than 100';
else echo 'It is a negative number. How tricky.';
</pre>
